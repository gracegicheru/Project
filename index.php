    <h1> Gracie's Philosophy of Fine Dining.</h1>
    <p> Here at Gracie's, We know that good food isn't about how expensive the dish is. We are not pompous, we're proud of our work, our quality, our environment, and our love for food and family.</p>
    <p> Oh, and you can call us Gracie's, you are Family. You can try all the type of steaks in our diner.</p>
